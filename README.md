# 🍽️ Restaurant Order Scheduler - Learn Scheduling Algorithms  

An interactive Android app built with **Jetpack Compose** that teaches **order scheduling algorithms** in a restaurant setting. Users can select meals, set priorities, and visualize how different scheduling methods process orders efficiently.  

## 📌 Features  

✅ **Intuitive UI:** Select meals with animated UI cards  
✅ **Multiple Scheduling Algorithms:**  
   - **FCFS (First Come, First Served)**  
   - **SJF (Shortest Job First)**  
   - **Priority Scheduling**  
   - **Round Robin (Time Quantum-Based)**  
   - **Multilevel Queue Scheduling**  
✅ **Visual Execution Log:** Watch how orders are processed dynamically  
✅ **Algorithm Comparison:** See performance differences in scheduling  

## 🎯 What You'll Learn  

🔹 How **CPU scheduling algorithms** apply to real-world problems  
🔹 The impact of **order priority & processing time** on efficiency  
🔹 Implementing **MVVM architecture** in Jetpack Compose  
🔹 Using **State Management** for UI updates
